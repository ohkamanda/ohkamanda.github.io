<a id="welcome-to-my-programming--design-portfolio" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-programming--design-portfolio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my programming &amp; design portfolio</h3>

<p>Hi there, and thanks for visiting my site.</p>

<p>My name is Amanda Proctor, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/ohkamanda">@ohkamanda</a>. I'm extremely passionate about programming, web development &amp; design, and so much more!</p>

<h3>
<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I'm a self taught web designer and Computer Science student, specializing in building Responsive Websites that look great on any device, as well as updating existing sites to make them mobile friendly. I can also provide domain and hosting services, help with Social Media, setup blogs, ecommerce sites, etc.</p>

<p>I've been building websites, hosting them, and worked as an affiliate marketer off and on for over half of my life now. I built and sold my first web hosting company before I could even drive, I worked with a partner on a little project that eventually turned into the website currently known as Sitepoint, and I've also built several blogs promoting affiliate programs that generated a passive income, until I had a few serious personal issues come up.</p>
        
<p>It was too much to handle at the time so I took a really long break from everything. Most of my old work was lost, so I'm basically starting over from scratch, relearning everything (the Web changes fast!), and ready to start rebuilding my blogs and taking on clients again as a freelancer.</p>

<h3>
<a id="my-goals" class="anchor" href="#my-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Goals</h3>

<p>I've started working on <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/ohkamanda" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> with the goal of getting their Full Stack Development Certificate sometime in 2017, and I'd love to start working with people again to use the skills I have to help businesses and non profits, both locally and Worldwide, improve their presence on the Internet.</p>

<p>I have experience with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, Bootstrap, web hosting, SEO, and even a little bit of Python. I'm always studying to keep my skills up to date, and recently I've started learning Ruby from <a href="http://upskillcourses.com" target="_blank">Upskill</a>, which is really fun.</p>
        
<p>If you're looking for someone to build or redesign your current site, you need help with SEO, Wordpress, social media, domain registration or web hosting, then feel free to <a href="#contact-me">get in touch</a>!</p>
