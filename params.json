{"name":"@ohkamanda's portfolio","tagline":"Some of my programming and design projects","body":"### Welcome to my programming portfolio\r\nHi, and welcome. My name is Amanda Proctor, aka @ohkamanda. I'm from Newnan, GA and still live near the area, but I've worked with clients from all over the world! I'm extremely passionate about programming, web development & design, and so much more...\r\n\r\n### My Goals\r\nI've started working on <http://freecodecamp.com> with the goal of getting their Full Stack Development Certificate in early 2016, and I want to use this space to share some of my solutions and work, and eventually to take on clients as a freelancer.\r\n\r\n### About me\r\nI'll be 30 years old in 17 more days, and I've been involved with and loved the art of designing and developing websites for over 15 years now. That's over half of my life! One accomplishment I'm really proud of is building and eventually selling my first web hosting company before I could legally drive. :)\r\n\r\nI have some experience with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, web hosting, SEO, and even a little bit of Python, but I'm always trying to learn more!\r\n\r\nI have profiles on codecademy at <https://www.codecademy.com/ohkamanda> and freecodecamp at <http://www.freecodecamp.com/ohkamanda>, and I'd highly recommend both of these sites to anyone else trying to learn this stuff!\r\n\r\n### Current projects\r\nI'm working on several different projects at the moment. I'll update this soon.\r\n\r\n### Contact me\r\nThe best way to reach me is by email, at ohkamanda@gmail.com. I also have a twitter account that's mostly related to bitcoin and cryptocurrency at <https://twitter.com/coinuser_>","google":"UA-71012760-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
