I'm from Newnan, GA and still live near the area in a nice community called Chattahoochee Hills. I'm extremely passionate about programming, web development & design, and so much more...\r\n\r\n### About me\r\nI'm a self taught web designer and Computer Science student, specializing in building Responsive Websites that look great on any device, as well as updating existing sites to make them mobile friendly. I can also provide hosting services, help with Social Media, setup blogs and ecommerce sites, plus more...\r\n\r\nI've been building websites, hosting them, and worked as an affiliate marketer off and on for over half of my life now. I built and sold my first web hosting company before I could even drive!\r\n\r\n### My Goals\r\n\r\nI've started working on [FCC](http://www.freecodecamp.com/ohkamanda) with the goal of getting their Full Stack Development Certificate sometime in early 2016, and my goal is to start working with clients again and use the skills I've learned to help small businesses and non profits, both locally and from all over the world, to improve their presence on the Internet.\r\n\r\nI have experience with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, web hosting, SEO, and even a little bit of Python, but I'm always trying to learn more. So if you're looking for someone to build or redesign your site, you need help with SEO or hosting then feel free to get in touch!\r\n\r\n### Current projects\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ohkamanda.github.io/Tim-Berners-Lee/\">A Tribute to Tim Berners-Lee</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ohkamanda.github.io/SlotMachine/\">JavaScript Slot Machine</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ohkamanda.github.io/FreeCodeCamp/\">Exercises from Free Code Camp</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ohkamanda.wordpress.com/\">My blog w/ more solutions from Free Code Camp</a></p>\r\n\r\n### Contact me\r\nThe best way to reach me is either by email, at ohkamanda@gmail.com, or my main twitter account: [@ohkamanda]<https://twitter.com/ohkamanda>.
